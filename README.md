# Team FAD UMLify GUI
Implemented by David Lam  
Property Parser by Adam Finer

## Description
This is a Graphic User Interface created for our UMLify project. It allows for the dynamic loading of classpaths. It also allows the user to either specific the path via Text field or select the file via File Explorer. Furthermore there is a built-in logger that displays a log of all activities done for a given session of the UI.
